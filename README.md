# go-tasks

Simple CLI to manage tasks written in Go.

Based on [@Dreams of Code](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io) project idea of a [tasks CLI](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/goprojects/tree/main/01-todo-list).

```bash
tasks add "new task" // creates a new task
tasks list // lists all unfinished tasks
tasks list -a // lists all tasks
tasks complete 4 // marks task with id 4 as done
tasks delete 4 // deletes task with id 4
```
